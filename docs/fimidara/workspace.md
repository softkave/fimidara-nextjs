## What is a workspace

A workspace is the root of all resources and operations in Fimidara. You can also think of a workspace as a special (root) folder identified by the rootname. But a workspace is not just for files and folders, it is also a collection of collaborators, tokens (program access and client assigned), permission groups, and other resources. To have others work with you in your workspace, you need to send a collaboration request. You do this by providing their email and Fimidara will send them a request to join your workspace. Should they accept the request, they will be able to access your workspace.

Collaboration request TODOs:

- [ ] Alert senders when request is accepted
- [ ] Allow requests to contain permission groups and items to grant on acceptance
