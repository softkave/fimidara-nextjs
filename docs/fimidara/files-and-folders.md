Fimidara's main offering is offering a file storage service with fine-grained access control. To make it easier to manage files and their permissions, Fimidara offers folders. With folders, you can group together similar files and folders, and then grant access to the whole group. Folders and files in Fimidara are identified by their path which is a slash-separated list of names with the workspace's rootname as the first name and the file or folder's name as the last name.
